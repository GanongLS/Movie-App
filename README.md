This App being developed by Luki Subandi. I intend to license this App under MIT License.

Fork or clone this repository to your personal repository.

How to run the App:

1. Setup React Native Environment in your personal PC based on this guide: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.
2. Open your remote personal repository that held the codebase for this up.
3. In the root folder run this int your terminal/command cli:
   1. Run `npm install` or `yarn`.
   2. Then run `react-native start` or `yarn start`.
   3. Then run `react-native run-android` or `yarn run-android`

In the Linux based OS you may find npm not running as expected you may need `npx react-native start` then `npx react-native run-android`.

If you find some error feel free to open issues.
